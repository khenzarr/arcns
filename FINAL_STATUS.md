### Canonical Subgraph
- Slug: `arcnslatest`
- Query URL: `https://api.studio.thegraph.com/query/1748590/arcnslatest/v3`
- Start block: `38856377`

- Pages: home/search, my-domains, resolve
- Wired exclusively to v3 contracts via `generated-contracts.ts`

### Working User Flows (confirmed in live manual testing)
- `.arc` registration (full commit-reveal: approve → commit → wait → register)
- `.circle` registration
- ERC-721 NFT mint on registration
- Forward resolution (`addr` record)
- Name renewal
- Transaction history (subgraph-backed)
- Primary name set at registration time
- Dashboard-driven primary name update
- Wrong-network guard (blocks writes on incorrect chain)
- Owned-domain-only primary name selection (no free-form text entry)

## 3. WHAT IS TESTED

### Contract Tests (`test/v3/`)
- **ArcNSRegistry** — node ownership, authorization, operator approval, all read/write functions
- **ArcNSBaseRegistrar** — availability, register, registerWithResolver, renew, ownerOf, reclaim, tokenURI, controller management, NotLive guard
- **ArcNSPriceOracle** — all 5 pricing tiers, pro-rated duration, premium decay (new/recent/decayed), setPrices
- **ArcNSResolver** — setAddr/addr round-trip, setName/name, CONTROLLER_ROLE authorization, setController, UUPS upgrade guard
- **ArcNSReverseRegistrar** — setName, setReverseRecord, node computation, claimWithResolver, independent per-address records
- **ArcNSController** — full commitment lifecycle (CommitmentTooNew, CommitmentExpired, CommitmentNotFound, replay, wrong sender, wrong secret), name validation (all invalid cases), payment (PriceExceedsMaxCost, insufficient balance, exact treasury transfer), resolver integration, reverse record (set, failure non-blocking), NFT ownership, renew, all admin functions, pause/unpause, UUPS upgrade guard
- **Integration** — deployment wiring, `.arc` and `.circle` full lifecycle, independent TLDs, resolver addr chain, reverse/primary name, renewal/expiry/grace, replay rejection, premium decay, maxCost protection, deploy script smoke test

### Frontend Tests (`frontend/src/__tests__/`)
- Error taxonomy, user-facing messages (no ENS wording), retryable classification
- `makeCommitment` 7-param shape, `buildRegisterArgs` 7-element tuple, `reverseNodeFor`, `maxCostWithSlippage`
- Commitment hash consistency, arg shape consistency
- **2 pre-existing failing tests** (`preservationTests.test.ts`, `bugConditionExploration.test.tsx`) — reference archived hooks, no production impact, must be fixed before mainnet

### Live / Manual Smoke Tests
All 10 flows in `docs/final/SMOKE_TEST_RESULTS.md` passed on Arc Testnet. Proved: the full commit-reveal registration flow works end-to-end with real USDC on a live chain, NFTs mint correctly, resolution works, subgraph indexes correctly, and the frontend handles all error states.

### Stale (safe to delete, deferred)
```

```

## 5. WHAT IS DEMO-READY

### Safe to Show in a Founder Demo
- `.arc` registration (full flow, live on-chain)
- `.circle` registration
- NFT proof on ArcScan
- Forward resolution (Resolve page)
- Primary name set and displayed
- Portfolio view (My Domains)
- Transaction history
- Wrong-network guard behavior

### Demo Caveats
- **62-second commit wait** is real and visible — use it to explain the anti-frontrun mechanism
- **Subgraph lag** (5–30 seconds after registration) — refresh after 30 seconds if history is empty
- **Public RPC congestion** — occasional txpool delays; retry after 30–60 seconds; use a private RPC for important demos
- **Primary name selector** requires subgraph to be indexed — if empty, shows a message; RPC fallback does not provide domain labels

### If Testnet Conditions Are Noisy
See `docs/final/FOUNDER_DEMO_FALLBACKS.md` — covers txpool busy, subgraph lag, wrong network, slow registration, and how to explain testnet constraints without undermining confidence.

## 6. WHAT IS NOT MAINNET-READY YET

The five most important blockers (full list in `docs/final/MAINNET_GAP_REPORT.md`):

1. **No external security audit.** No external audit has been performed. This is a hard blocker.
2. **Single-EOA role concentration.** All admin roles, upgrade authority, and treasury are controlled by one key. Must be replaced with multisigs before mainnet.
3. **No upgrade time-lock.** UPGRADER_ROLE allows immediate upgrades with no delay. A time-lock is required.
4. **Mainnet USDC address unconfirmed.** Testnet USDC (`0x3600...0000`) is not mainnet USDC. Contracts must be redeployed with the confirmed mainnet address.
5. **Public RPC dependency.** The frontend relies on public Arc Testnet RPCs. Dedicated infrastructure is required for mainnet.

Additionally: 2 failing frontend tests must be fixed, reentrancy adversarial tests must be added, and automated UUPS storage layout verification must be in CI.

---

## 7. NEXT LOGICAL MILESTONE

**Milestone: Audit + Hardening + Mainnet Preparation**

Concrete deliverables for this milestone:

1. Engage external security auditor — scope: all 6 v3 contracts
2. Resolve all audit findings
3. Implement upgrade time-lock contract
4. Transfer all admin roles to multisig
5. Transfer treasury to multisig
6. Confirm mainnet USDC address
7. Add reentrancy adversarial tests + automated storage layout check to CI
8. Fix 2 failing frontend tests
9. Deploy subgraph to decentralized hosting
10. Deploy frontend to production domain
11. Provision dedicated RPC for mainnet
12. Redeploy all contracts on mainnet
13. Complete mainnet smoke test matrix
14. Publish audit report and mainnet addresses

**Estimated scope:** 6–10 weeks depending on audit timeline.

**Gate:** All 25 acceptance criteria in `docs/final/MAINNET_GAP_REPORT.md` Section 6 must be met before mainnet launch.
